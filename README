# Library Management System

This is a library management system designed to help libraries manage their book inventory and user accounts efficiently. It provides functionalities for adding, deleting, and updating books, as well as managing user accounts with different roles.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in with their username and password. Different roles (e.g., user and manager) have different permissions.
- **Book Management:** Managers can add, delete, update, and view books. Users with limited access can only view books.
- **User Management:** Managers can view and manage user accounts, including creating new accounts and deleting existing ones.
- **Lending System:** Books can be lent out to users and returned when no longer needed.
